This repository showcases a rather uncommon bug in Java related to loop control and conditional break statements.  The bug is subtle and might be missed during standard code reviews. The `UncommonBug.java` file contains the buggy code, while `UncommonBugSolution.java` demonstrates the correction. The bug is caused by improper handling of break statements when a conditional check is made within a loop.
